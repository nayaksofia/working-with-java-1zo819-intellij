File Object::
--------------
> A file object is independent of the file system. It can be used to access it.

Several Key Points For File ::
---------------
- Create and Delete Files
- Create Directories
- Analyze the path
- Get the real path to a file or directory
- With files you can copy and move files

Why another model for  a path ?
------------------------------------------
-  the File class is here to stay
-  a File does not know the file system.
-  no access to specific features

Solution:: One interface with specific implementation
Give access to specific features of the file system.
This is why path interface is created.

There are two APIs:
----------------------
> File Class: File is a class from Java I/O
> Path Interface: Path is an Interface from Java NIO2

Several key points for a Path:
---------------------------------
- parent : everything before the last /
- root : may not exist, file system dependent
- absolute path : identified by the file system

- A file with a root may not be an absolute path.

Path :: Four methods to keep in mind
-------------------------------------
- resolve()
- resolveSibling()
- relativize()
- normalize()

Several traps to avoid ::
-----------------------------
- A File is a class, A  Path is an Interface.
- A File is not linked to File System.
- A Path is created from a File System.
- A Path with a root may not be absolute.

Reader Key Points::
--------------------------
- a reader must be closed
- exceptions will be thrown
- it can read character
- it may support marking
- chars can be skipped

Writer Key Points ::
---------------------
- A writer must be closed
- It can be flushed
- It write characters

Buffering Key Points:
---------------
> BufferedReader extend the Abstract Reader Class .[Extend and compose ==> Decorator Pattern]

> Java I/O is built on the Decorator Pattern.

- BufferedReader is decorator of Reader
- read and write lines
- writer support charset
- writer supports standard options

OutputStream Key Points:
---------------------------

- It must be closed.
- It can be flushed.
- It can write bytes.

InputStream Key Points:
-------------------------------
- It must be closed.
- Exceptions may be thrown
- It can read bytes
- It may support marking
- bytes can be skipped


> An InputStreamReader is a Reader that is built on an InputStream .

> An OutputStreamWriter is a Writer that is built on an OutputStream.

Serialization key points:

-  The process of taking an object from the memory and writing it on the stream of bytes is called
 serialization and the inverse process is called de-serialization.

- Only Serializable Objects can be serialized .

- Are methods there in this Serializable interface ?
 Ans . No . There are no methods in Serializable Interface.

- If your class implements serializable it can define a serialVersionUID.

- de-serializing an object may lead to partially reconstructed objects.
