Git Vs. GitHub::
-----------------------------
Explanation With Example ::
Think of Git as a Single computer and GitHub as a network of multiple interconnected computers, all
with the same end goal but a widely different role for how to get there.

To push an existing repository from a command line :
--------------------------
Create a new repository in GitHub. Then write the following command.
Eg:
git remote add origin https://github.com/nayaksofia/working-with-java-1z0819-april2023.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


git pull ::
-----------
Git Pull is a command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote repository.
It is a mixture of two other commands:
git fetch
git merge

The [ git fetch ] command does not force to merge the changes into the repository while the
[git pull] command not only download the remote content but also merges it into the current working copy.

> Command :: git pull origin main
             git pull <remote> <branch>

 If you are sure that the repositories are related, then you can try running the following command before the pull command:

 > git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories


After that you can push your changes to the remote repository:

> Command :: git push origin main
